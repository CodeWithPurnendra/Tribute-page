            <h2>Early life and education</h2>
            <hr>

            <p>Huang was born in <strong>Taipei, Taiwan</strong> and moved to the southern city of Taiwan as a child he
                is the younger of two sons of Huang Hsing-tai, a <strong>chemical engineer</strong> at <strong>oil
                    refinery</strong>, and Lo Tsai-hsiu, a <strong>schoolteacher.</strong>They were a middle-class
                Taiwanese family that relocated often. Each day, Jensen's mother randomaly selected 10 words from the
                dictionary to teach her sons English. When he was 5 years old,Huang's family moved to Thailand to
                support his father's refinery work and remained threr for approximately 4 years. He attended
                <strong>Ruamrudee International School</strong> while in <strong>Bangkok.</strong></p>

            <p>In the late 1960s, Hsing-tai traveled from Taiwan to New York City to train under an air conditioning
                company and, after returning home, resolved to send his sons to the United States At age nine, Jensen,
                despite not being able to speak English, was sent by his parents to live in the United States He and his
                older brother moved in 1973 to live with an uncle in Tacoma, Washington, escaping widespread social
                unrest in Thailand Both Huang's aunt and uncle were recent immigrants to Washington state; they
                accidentally enrolled him and his brother in the Oneida Baptist Institute, a religious reform academy in
                Kentucky for troubled youth mistakenly believing it to be a prestigious boarding school.In order to
                afford the academy's tuition, Jensen's parents sold nearly all their possessions.</p>

            <p>When he was 10 years old, Huang lived with his older brother in the Oneida boys' dormitory. Each
                student was expected to work every day, and his brother was assigned to perform manual labor on a nearby
                tobacco farm Because he was too young to attend classes at the reform academy, Huang was educated
                at a separate public school—the Oneida Elementary school in Oneida, Kentucky—arriving as "an undersized
                Asian immigrant with long hair and heavily accented English" and was frequently bullied and
                beaten. In Oneida, Huang cleaned toilets every day, learned to play table-tennis,joined the
                swimming team, and appeared in Sports Illustrated at age 14. He taught his illiterate roommate,
                a "17-year-old covered in tattoos and knife scars," how to read in exchange for being taught how to
                bench press. In 2002, Huang recalled that he remembered his life in Kentucky "more vividly than just
                about any other".</p>

               <p>Two years after Huang arrived in Oneida, his parents moved to the United States and settled in Beaverton, Oregon, where the brothers withdrew from school in Kentucky to live back with them. As a teenager, Huang attended Aloha High School in Aloha, Oregon, where he excelled academically. He skipped two grades, graduated at age 16, and became a nationally ranked table-tennis player in addition to being a member of its mathematics, computer, and science clubs. Beginning at age 15, Huang also got his first job working the graveyard shift at a local Denny's restaurant as a dishwasher,busboy, and waiter from 1978 to 1983
